# Copy & Link Extension

**Copy & Link** is a Chrome extension designed to streamline the process of copying text along with links for easy sharing and reference.

### Key Features:
1. **Copy selected text with a link to the current page**:
    - Select any text on a webpage and copy it along with the URL of the page you're on. This is perfect for when you want to share content and give context to where it came from.

2. **Copy selected text with a link to a previously copied URL**:
    - If youâ€™ve already copied a URL from another source, you can use this option to attach that URL to any text you select on the current webpage. This is useful when referencing external content in your messages or documents.

With **Copy & Link**, sharing references and links becomes a breeze, allowing you to quickly create linked text that can be pasted into emails, documents, or chat messages.
